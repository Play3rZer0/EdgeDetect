# EdgeDetect
Edge detection using ImageChops

This is for comparing two images pixel by pixel using edge detection.

When you see any variations in the image, it is not the same as the original.

Prepare 2 image files (JPEG format preferable). One image file is the original and the 
second image file is the one that you want to compare it to.
